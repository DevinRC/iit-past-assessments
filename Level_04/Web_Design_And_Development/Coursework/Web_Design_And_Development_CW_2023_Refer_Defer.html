<tr><td><p>
<b>Assigned:</b> 21st August 2023<br>
<b>Submission: </b>4th September 2023 <b>before</b> 1:00 pm LK TIME<br>

<b>Expected deliverables: </b>Submitted via Blackboard:
<ul>
<li>Your individual report submitted as a single PDF or Word document;
<!--</li><li>URLs to your individual work on the university server in a text file;-->
</li><li>also, your individual web pages/files (E.g., HTML/CSS/JavaScript). Blackboard will require that you zip your files into one folder to upload.
</ul>
<b>Mark Allocation: </b>50% of module total. 
<p>
<b>Specification:</b> 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation (72 marks)   <br>
Prepare a Web site about yourself. This should include the following.  
<ol>
<li>      A presentation page with title. After 3 seconds, a second page will be displayed (Main page). 
</li><li>      Your Main page should contain navigation links to the other pages of your website and the links should look like buttons. 
The 'buttons' should have a hover effect and be created using CSS and HTML.  Your site should contain a separate page for each of these features: your CV, ideal job, query form and SVG diagram (see details below).
<li>Your CV with headings and anchors (e.g. links at the top to take the user to various sections of your CV such as Education, Work Experience, etc )
</li><li>Your ideal job (description, location, responsibilities, colleagues, etc.) 
</li><li>A form to allow people to send you a query about your CV or your ideal job. (
For example, a query about your programing experience, other experience, transferable skills etc). 
The form should be set up to email the contents of the form to yourselves, but this will take 2 steps, see details below. 
This form should include:
<ul>
<li>input fields for users to enter their details (name, email address)
<li>a textarea to enter their query detail 
<li>a way to select the theme of the query (using  radio buttons or select). There must be a minimum of 3 subjects to choose from (e.g., programing experience, other experience, transferable skills). 
<li>a &apos;view query&apos; button. When this button is clicked, check, using JavaScript, that the user has filled-in the compulsory fields - 'name', 'email address', 'query subject' and 'query details'. Do NOT use HTML5 validation for this part. If some fields are missing, use a popup message (alert) to let the user know which fields are missing.
<li>If all the required fields are filled in, the name, email address, query subject, and the query detail from the form should be displayed on the page (using innerHTML) in a summary that will include all these details (the name, email address, query subject and the query details).
<li>For example, if the user entered &apos;Juan&apos; for their name, &apos;juan@gmail.com&apos; for their email address, and the subject of the query was &apos;programming experience&apos; and they entered &apos;How much experience do you have on JavaScript?&apos; as the text of their query detail, when they press the check button, the form disappears and the display on the page should say something like:<br> 
<br>
Name: Juan<br>
Email: juan@gmail.com<br>
Subject: programming experience<br>
Details: How much experience do you have on JavaScript?<br>
<br>

With two new buttons: Edit and Send.<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>When the user presses edit, the displayed details disappear and this is replaced with the initial form which reappears with the information filled in. If they press send, the displayed details disappear also and the form is sent by email. 
</li>
</ul>
</li><li> Your site should contain an interactive SVG diagram to show the architecture of your site. 
</li><li>Consistency of style should be used throughout the Web site, with the use a common external style sheet file. 
</li><li>Each page should include your title logo at the top, and a link your email address at the bottom of the page. 
</li><li>Feel free to use Tables, Images, CSS, JavaScript to add interactivity and increase ease of navigation. 
</li>

<li><!--You should submit your web pages to your area on the university server and--> All the web pages should link together.
</li><li>All pages should be validated with no errors using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">https://validator.w3.org/</a> 
<ul>
<li>Take screen shots of your results to add to your report (up to 4 pages).
<li>Note: warnings are acceptable. </li>
